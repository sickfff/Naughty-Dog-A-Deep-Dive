## 📜 Origins

Naughty Dog was founded in 1984 by Andy Gavin and Jason Rubin under the name **Jam Software**. Initially developing for the Apple II, they pivoted toward consoles and eventually struck gold on the PlayStation with *Crash Bandicoot*.

Their breakthrough came with Sony’s support, which led to a partnership that continues to this day.
